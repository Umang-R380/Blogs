# The Fundamentals of Complex Analysis

Complex analysis is the branch of mathematics that investigates functions of complex numbers. It is an extremely powerful tool with applications in many areas, including number theory, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics.

### Euler's Formula

One of the most beautiful and fundamental equations in all of mathematics is Euler's formula:

$$ e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta) $$

Setting $\theta = \pi$ gives the famous Euler's identity:

$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$

This equation elegantly connects five of the most important constants in mathematics.
