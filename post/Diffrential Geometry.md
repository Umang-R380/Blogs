# An Introduction to Differential Geometry

Differential geometry is the study of smooth manifolds. In simple terms, these are spaces that, on a small enough scale, look like Euclidean space ($\mathbb{R}^n$). This allows us to use calculus to study geometry.

One of the key concepts is the metric tensor, $g_{ij}$, which allows us to measure distances and angles on the manifold.

### The Einstein Field Equations

In general relativity, the curvature of spacetime is related to the distribution of matter and energy. This is described by the Einstein Field Equations:

$$ R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} $$

Where:
- $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor.
- $R$ is the scalar curvature.
- $g_{\mu\nu}$ is the metric tensor.
- $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor.
